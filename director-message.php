                            <p>Ventilation has never been just a profession for me—it’s a passion rooted in curiosity and purpose. The journey began back in my childhood, during a visit to our 80-year-old family home. I was fascinated by how the movement of natural air could transform comfort and space. That experience sparked a lifelong interest in the harmony between airflow, design, and human well-being.</p>

                            <p>Years later, while pursuing my degree in Mechanical Engineering, that curiosity evolved into conviction. My work in the field of pre-engineered buildings revealed a pressing challenge—industries struggling with poor ventilation, excessive heat, and energy inefficiency. I realized that traditional methods were no longer enough. There was a clear need for smarter, sustainable, and performance-driven ventilation solutions.</p>

                            <p>That realization gave birth to Marut Air—a vision to redefine industrial ventilation with innovation, efficiency, and environmental responsibility at its core. Today, every system we design carries that same passion I discovered as a child—the belief that air, when engineered right, can truly transform spaces and the lives within them.</p>
